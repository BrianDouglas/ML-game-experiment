# ML-game-experiment
US-davis final project utilizing RL to train ai to play a simple maze game

## Goals
1. start by building a simple grid game in javascript that a user can play online.
    * collect game play data and store it in a mongoDB for analysis
2. teach a RL deep q network to play the game.
    * allow website visitors to observe the ai playing the game.
3. Increase the complexity/scale of the game environment
    * observe how well the model generalizes to a new environment.
